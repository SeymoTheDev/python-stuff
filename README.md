# python-stuff
python-stuff consists of some of my best, and maybe even worst projects, coded in numerous different languages, mostly python!


# Check out some of my stuff!
This is liscensed under MIT, Meaning you get to download, and expand on my code!
If you see something you think should be changed, change it!!

# REPUBLISHING!!

You may republish my work, under 3 conditions..


1. You must change 3 COMPONENTS OF MY WORK
2. Dont just reupload it without changing anything. at least the name, and some of the code
3. You may republish, but do NOT republish it as **python stuff beta** or something like that.

# AND HAVE FUN!
enjoy looking through the code, exploring python, ***i hope you learn something today, or tomorrow*** :D
